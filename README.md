# Motorcycle Collection in Svelte 

This project is a web-based motorcycle collection application built with Svelte, a modern, lightweight, and efficient JavaScript framework. In its current form, it provides users with the ability to showcase their motorcycle collections. 

The longer-term vision for this project is to evolve it into a full-fledged social network, where users can not only share their own motorcycles but also view, comment on, and interact with the collections of others.
